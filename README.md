# Horiseon-Services
 
The purpose of this project is to refactor the Horiseon websites code by making its code more efficient, understandable, and accessible without changing the page's appearance.
 

## Completed
 
 - Consolidation to excessive classes.
 - I inserted semantic HTML elements.
 - The title was changed to be more descriptive, which improves search enging optimization.
 - I added alt text to images to provide context for screen readers.
 - Explanatory comments were added in the HTML. 
 - CSS was reorganized logically.
