# Horiseon-Services
 
The purpose of this project is to refactor the Horiseon websites code by making its code more efficient, understandable, and accessible without changing the page's appearance. My motivation in completing this project was to gain experience and understanding in HTML and CSS, and why refactoring code is important.
 

## Completed
 
 - Consolidation to excessive classes.
 - I inserted semantic HTML elements.
 - The title was changed to be more descriptive, which improves search enging optimization.
 - I added alt text to images to provide context for screen readers.
 - Explanatory comments were added in the HTML. 
 - CSS was reorganized logically.
